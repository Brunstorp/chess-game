So the idea is essenially to create a chess game. Initally we just want to get it to work and move the pieces through the gui. Next I am going to implement the same thing but for accessible for a computer. 
Afterwards (waaay down the line) the idea is to also build a chess computer and play against that

I also need:
check for checkmate, stalemate

GUI:
how can I implement a clock? 
How can I implement highlighting of selected square/piece? 
How can I implement to show who's turn it is? 

How to diplay who won in gui? 
How can I create a choice for promotion (right now purely queen)
How can I make it possible to go back and forth in moves? (and also display that)
How can I make the legal moves of a piece be printed out in the gui?

Now what happens if I flip directly after picking a square?
