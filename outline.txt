So the idea is essenially to create a chess game. Initally we just want to get it to work and move the pieces through the gui. Next I am going to implement the same thing but for accessible for a computer. 
Afterwards (waaay down the line) the idea is to also build a chess computer and play against that
I think next step is to start implementing legal moves
I also need:
check for checkmate, stalemate
castling, and castling rightd
promotion
en passant
how are we going to handle checks?
How am I going to handle pins?

We only need to check for checkmate after a check
stalemate is when one player has no moves but is not in check

and then who knows I might even build a chess960 emulator

GUI:
how can I implement a clock? How can I implement highlighting of selected square/piece? How can I implement to show who's turn it is? How can I flip the board? (that one will be really hard)

pawn:
moves correctly, haven't implemented en passant nor promotion, 

rook:
moves correctly, no castling yet

king:
moves correctly, no castling and I need to add check, checkmate

queen:
moves correctly, actually done

knight:
moves correctly, done

bishop:
moves correctly, done

then I mean the plan is to make a dockerfile, make this into an application, and have a local chess computer
