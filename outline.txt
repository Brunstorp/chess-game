So the idea is essenially to create a chess game. Initally we just want to get it to work and move the pieces through the gui. Next I am going to implement the same thing but for accessible for a computer. 
Afterwards (waaay down the line) the idea is to also build a chess computer and play against that
I think next step is to start implementing legal moves
I also need:
check for checkmate, stalemate

We only need to check for checkmate after a check
stalemate is when one player has no moves but is not in check

and then who knows I might even build a chess960 emulator

GUI:
how can I implement a clock? How can I implement highlighting of selected square/piece? How can I implement to show who's turn it is? How can I flip the board? (that one will be really hard)
How can I implement so if we click a piece, and click a square where it can't move, that piece is just still selected in the gui? How to diplay who won in gui?
