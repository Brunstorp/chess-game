So the idea is essenially to create a chess game. Initally we just want to get it to work and move the pieces through the gui. Next I am going to implement the same thing but for accessible for a computer. 
Afterwards (waaay down the line) the idea is to also build a chess computer and play against that
I think next step is to start implementing legal moves
I also need:
check for checkmate, stalemate
castling, and castling rightd
promotion
en passant
how are we going to handle checks?
How am I going to handle pins?
I just realized that it might be good to let the pieces also see the chessboard

and then who knows I might even build a chess960 emulator
